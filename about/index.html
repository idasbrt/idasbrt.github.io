	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Hello! I am a Balinese woman with more than 3 years of working experience across various Data Analytics roles in Sydney, Australia. 
    Despite coming from a Finance background and initially setting my goal to become an Equity Research Analyst, I became interested in data 
    visualisation and fell in love with Tableau since the first time I discovered it in 2017. <br><br>

    As a Freelance Data Analyst working from Bali (hence the name of this blog), I deliver Tableau reporting solutions to clients in Australia and 
    Indonesia, ranging from interactive benchmarking reports to survey results analysis. Solving complex problems, finding the best ways to analyse
    & communicate data, and helping clients to better understand their data are the things that make this career path rewarding and enjoyable for me.<br><br>

    When I am not occupied with work, I enjoy spending my time trying new dishes around my hometown, watching TV shows & K-dramas, and playing with my dogs.
